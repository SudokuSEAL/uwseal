				<h5>What is an industrial assessment?</h5>
				<p class="container-fluid">
					Our team of faculty and students from the Department of Electrical Engineering
					offers free, in-depth assessments of area manufacturers and plants. Our goal is to
					help you save on energy costs by identifying potential savings in three areas:
					<li>Energy efficiency
					<li>Waste minimization and pollution prevention
					<li>Productivity
				</p>

				<h5>What can the IAC do for your business?</h5>
				<p class="container-fluid">
					Recommendations from industrial assessments have averaged about $55,000 in potential
					annual savings for each manufacturer.
				<p>Assessments generally entail a one or two day site visit, followed by a detailed
					analysis for specific recommendations, including estimates of costs,
					performance, and payback times.
				<p>Within 60 days, a confidential report detailing the analysis, findings and
					recommendations of the team is sent to the plant. In two to six months,
					follow-up phone calls are placed to the plant manager to verify recommendations
					that will be implemented.
				</p>

				<h5>Who is eligible for an IAC assessment?</h5>
				<p class="container-fluid">
					Any business that meets the following criteria:
					<li>Falls within Standard Industrial Codes (SIC) 20-39
					<li>Located less than 150 miles of a participating university
					<li>Reports gross annual sales of less than $100 million
					<li>Has fewer than 500 employees at the plant site
					<li>Pays annual energy bills of no less than $100,000 and no more than $3,500,000
					<li>Has no professional in-house staff to perform the assessment
				</p>

				<h5>What can I expect from an assessment?</h5>
				<p class="container-fluid">
					<b>Plant Visit and Tour</b>
				<p>We will schedule a day for our IAC team to spend touring your facility and
					collecting data on the operation of your equipment. This visit should last about
					8 hours. For the purposes of the assessment, we may need to meet with the
					following people:
					<li>Accountant
					<li>Electrician
					<li>Equipment Operators
					<li>Plant Engineer
					<li>Environmental Manager
					<li>Maintenance/Facilities Manager
					<li>Production Manager
					<li>Quality Manager
						<p>We would like to spend about an hour touring your plant with one of your
							employees who has knowledge about all aspects of your process. The
							person leading the tour should be able to point out areas on which you
							would like us to concentrate. After the tour, we will meet with selected
							staff from your plant to discuss any opportunities for potential
							savings.
						<p>We will spend the next three to four hours gathering the data we will
							need to analyze the recommendations that we are considering. This
							includes measuring temperatures, pressures, power, and flow rates, as
							well as collecting operating schedules, quality statistics, and
							downtime.
						<p>At the end of the day, we will meet again with your staff to present the
							opportunities we think will offer significant savings. Your comments are
							extremely valuable to ensure that our list includes the right
							opportunities for you.

						<p><b>The Assessment</b>
						<p>In the weeks following our visit we may call or email you to clarify some
							points about your facility. We try to get as much information as
							possible during our visit but additional details may be required for a
							complete analysis. Within two months you will receive a report
							containing specific recommendations on ways to improve productivity,
							reduce energy costs, and minimize waste, including estimates of
							implementation costs and payback periods.

						<p><b>The Follow-Up</b>
						<p>We will call you in 6 to 12 months to find out which recommendations you
							were able to implement. We may also ask you if a representative of the
							U.S. Department of Energy, which funds the program, can visit or call
							you. This follow-up interview will take no more than half an hour.
